## Why Data Science
Admittedly, the driving force that started me down the data science path was to find a career that would support my already growing family. But, as I went deeper into the content, I unexpectedly fell in  love with exploring data and uncovering insights that translate into more optimized business practices.

## The Material

The content of this blog encompasses only some what I have explored including topics such as machine learning, statistics and python. I also have showcased some practical skills on my github [here.](https://github.com/mitty4)

## My Outlook
I am very excited to delve into gathering, cleaning and analyzing data. This part of data science is much like detective work because I have to look for connections in the data that are meaningful enough to draw conclusions. Exploring the data really satiates the curosity in me and, at the same time, it exercises my creative side by how I look for connections in the data.

## My Top Traits

- Empathetic
- Detail-oriented
- Goal-driven (balances out the detail oriented trait)
- Creative
- Team Player
