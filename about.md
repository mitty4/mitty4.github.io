## Why Data Science
Initially, I  searched for a career that would support my already growing family, but, as I went deeper into the content, I unexpectedly _fell in love with_ exploring data and uncovering insights that translate into more optimized business practices.

## The Material

The content of this blog encompasses only some what I have explored including topics such as machine learning, statistics and python. I also have showcased some practical skills on my github [here.](https://github.com/mitty4)

## My Outlook
I am very excited and engaged by gathering, cleaning and analyzing data. This part of data science is much like detective work because I have to find connections in the data that are meaningful enough to draw conclusions or to make big fancy business decisions backed by real hard data. So, exploring the data really satiates the curosity in me and, at the same time, it exercises my creative side. See some of my other complementary traits for data science below.

## My Top Traits
