## Why Data Science
Admittedly, the driving force that started me down the data science path was to find a career that would support my already growing family. But, as I went deeper into the content, I unexpectedly fell in  love with exploring data and uncovering insights that translate into more optimized business practices.

## The Material

The content of this blog encompasses only some what I have explored including topics such as machine learning, statistics and python. I also have showcased some practical skills on my github [here.](https://github.com/mitty4)

## My Outlook
I am very excited and engaged with gathering, cleaning and analyzing data. This part of data science is much like detective work because I have to find connections in the data that are meaningful enough to draw conclusions/make decisions. Exploring the data really satiates the curosity in me and, at the same time, it exercises my creative side. 

## My Top Traits

- Empathetic
- Detail-oriented
- Goal-driven (balances out the perfectionism in me)
- Creative
- Team Player
