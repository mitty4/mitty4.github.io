##### plotting - 2 styles
In order to plot a function, employ either the OOP style or just use the straight .pyplot style. The docs for the OOP style say "explicitly create figures and axes, and call methods on them" while the pyplot style says "rely on pyplot to automatically create and manage the figures and axes, and use pyplot functions for plotting." 

There is an accepted standard, which is to use the oop style when writing scripts and other reusable code while the pyplot style should be restricted to interactive plotting such as in use with jupyter notebooks.
