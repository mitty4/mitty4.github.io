1) How does reinforcement learning compare to supervised and unsupervised learning?

Reinforcement learning is different than unsupervised learning by its intended result, which is to learn an action. An RL model will learn from feedback  as it interacts with its environment similar to how a child would learn by positive or negative feedback from a parent. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, aims to find similarities among data points.
