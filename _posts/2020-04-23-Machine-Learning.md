A decision tree is a classification algorithm that can be represented visually by starting with one node that has two branches coming off it. Each branch leads to another node until an end state is reached. With each node, there is a decision to be made, which determines which branch to follow to the next node and eventually the result/answer.

Entropy and information gain equal one. Entropy of 1 is complete disorder. Information gain brings order. Attributes that provide more information gain are more valuable. 

## What is machine learning?

Machine learning(ML) is a computer program that can learn by example. In other words ML uses algorithms to learn from previous intentionally provided and non provided examples. 

The first category of machine learning is called supervised learning, which is where the data is given to the algorithm. Examples of this are both classification and regression. They use training data.

Regression allows for a predictive environment. Different types of ML classify as predictive because they use an algorithm to suggest the most likely value from one or many variables. For example, in retail, predictive algorithms can be used to predict what and where a type of consumer will buy. 

Classification algorithms answer mostly yes and no questions. They classify the dependant variable into a category. For example, emails have spam detection that organize or classify emails into a spam folder that are more likely to be a spam email.
