Hyperbolic functions are s-shaped just like sigmoidal, however, the range for these is -1 to 1, which makes this function typical for classification between two classes.

Both tanh and sigmoidal functions are used for feed forward nets.

Let's make this simple from the start: sigmoid is synonymous with logistic and it exists between 0 and 1, which makes it ideal for probability functions because the range for probability exists between 0 and 1!
